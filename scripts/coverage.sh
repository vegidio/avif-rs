# Generate a code-coverage report for avif-rs using cargo-llvm-cov.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/coverage.sh           # build an HTML report and open it in a browser
#   scripts/coverage.sh --lcov    # emit target/coverage/lcov.info instead (for tooling/CI)
#
# Coverage runs the full test suite (unit + integration). The integration tests exercise
# assets/image.jpg and assets/image.avif. The libavif static binaries are downloaded
# automatically by build.rs.
#
# The machine-generated FFI bindings are excluded: avif-rs generates them at build time with
# `bindgen` into `OUT_DIR/bindings.rs` (included by `src/sys.rs`) — hundreds of `extern`
# declarations, type aliases and constants that can't be "executed", so counting them would
# understate the real, hand-written coverage.
